  text_with_linebreaks: |
    this is a multiline text with linebreaks
    that are reproduced in the value
       inside there may be indentations
    and this continues the previous block text
  Without_linebreaks: >
    in this case the line breaks of the multiline text
    get replaced by space characters
    
    empty lines with the same indentation start a new paragraph

  decription: several independent dictionaries may exist in one file

    this is a plain multiline
    folded string value

    string"
